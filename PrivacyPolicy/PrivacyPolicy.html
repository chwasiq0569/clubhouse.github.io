                <p class="secondaryText">We collect information that alone or in combination with other
                    information in our possession could be used to identify you <span>(“Personal Data”)</span> as
                    follows:</p>
                <p class="secondaryText"><span>Personal Data You Provide:</span> We collect the following categories of
                    Personal Data
                    from you when you use our Service, including when you sign up for an account, create or share
                    content, and message or communicate with others:</p>
                <ul class="underlined">
                    <li><span>Information you provide:</span> We collect content, communications, and other information
                        you provide,
                        including when you sign up for an account, create or share content, and message or communicate
                        with others. To create and manage an account, you may provide us with personal data, including
                        your name, phone number, a photo of yourself, an email address, and a username. We use your
                        contact information to authenticate your account and keep it secure and to communicate with you
                        about the Service</li>
                    <li><span>Audio:</span> Solely for the purpose of supporting incident investigations, we temporarily
                        record the
                        audio in a room while the room is live. If a user reports a Trust and Safety violation while the
                        room is active, we retain the audio for the purposes of investigating the incident, and then
                        delete it when the investigation is complete. If no incident is reported in a room, we delete
                        the temporary audio recording when the room ends. Audio from (i) muted speakers and (ii)
                        audience members is never captured, and all temporary audio recordings are encrypted.</li>
                    <li><span>Networks and connections:</span> We collect information about the people, accounts, and
                        clubs you are
                        connected to and how you interact with them through our Service. If you choose to upload, sync,
                        or import device information to Clubhouse (such as contacts in your address book), we may use
                        this information to enhance your experience in various ways, including, but not limited to,
                        notifying you when a contact has joined the waitlist or the Service. In addition, other users
                        who have your contact information and have chosen to upload, sync, or import it from their
                        device may be notified of when you join our Service (e.g., so they can join your “welcome
                        room”); they may be able to know the number of people on the Service who have your number in
                        their uploaded contacts, so that they can choose to invite people with many friends already on
                        the Service. Finally, may we use your list of contacts (if you choose to provide us with access
                        to them) to recommend other users you might want to follow and to recommend your account and
                        content to others.</li>

                        accounts you interact with, and the time, frequency, and duration of your use.</li>
                    <li><span>Communication Data:</span> We may choose to collect information when you contact us with
                        questions or
                        concerns and when you voluntarily respond to requests for your opinion and feedback.</li>

                    <li><span>Thoughtfully curate the speaker group:</span> Great moderators are thoughtful about who
                        they invite to
                        speak, and try to include diverse people, personalities, and perspectives. A moderator can
                        decide to run a "party room" with a lot of speakers, or a fireside chat with just a couple. All
                        types of rooms can work, and it’s up to each moderator to develop their own style.</li>
                    <li><span>Actively manage the conversation:</span> Some speakers are comfortable talking at length,
                        while others
                        are more reserved. Moderators can be a positive, balancing force, asking the quieter speakers to
                        share their perspectives and posing questions to the group.</li>
                    <li><span>Consider the audience experience:</span> Listeners enjoy joining the stage to ask
                        questions,
                        participate in the discussion, or even offer feedback in real-time. Take their questions when
                        appropriate, or feel free to focus on the current speakers—it’s totally up to you. When you do
                        take questions, it’s okay to return a listener to the audience after the question is answered.
