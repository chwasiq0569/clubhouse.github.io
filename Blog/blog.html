                <p class="secondaryText">Hi there! üëãüèΩ Clubhouse is currently in early beta and we‚Äôre learning
                    a lot
                    each day. As we open up to a broader audience, we expect this document to evolve. If you have any
                    feedback or suggestions, we‚Äôd love to hear from you.</p>
                <div class="emptySpace"></div>
                <p class="primaryText">These Community Guidelines are meant to help you better understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The principles that we think make Clubhouse a special place</li>
                    <li>The primary roles that users play in Clubhouse</li>
                    <li>The rules we expect you to abide by as a Clubhouse user</li>

                <h3 class="primaryHeading">Principles</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText underlined">Clubhouse was designed to be a space for authentic conversation and
                    expression‚Äîwhere people can have fun, learn, make meaningful connections, and share rich experiences
                    with others around the world. Below are a few guiding principles that we believe are important.</p>
                <ul class="underlined">
                    <li><span>Be yourself.</span> The authenticity of Clubhouse begins with the people.</li>
                    <li><span>Be respectful.</span> This applies to every person, at all times.</li>
                    <li><span>Be inclusive.</span> Tolerate, welcome, and consider diverse people and perspectives.</li>
                    <li><span>Build empathy and understanding.</span> Engage in debates that are in good faith.</li>
                    <li><span>Foster meaningful and genuine connections.</span> This is what Clubhouse is all about.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="secondaryText">Please note that these principles are intended to be high-level guidelines
                    only. If you‚Äôre interested in knowing what can get people kicked off Clubhouse, please see the Rules
                    sections below. üôÇ</p>
                <div class="emptySpace"></div>
                <h3 class="primaryHeading">Roles</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText underlined">Conversations in Clubhouse take place in <span>rooms</span>. Within
                    each room,
                    you can
                    be a <span>moderator</span>, a <span>speaker</span>, or a <span>listener</span>. Below are some of
                    the best
                    practices
                    for
                    each role.</p>
                <h3 class="secondaryHeading">Moderator</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText">When you start a room in Clubhouse, you are the moderator. This
                    means you are a speaker with the special power to add or remove other speakers. As a moderator, you
                    guide the conversation and have a strong influence on the content and style of conversation in the
                    room.</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">In Clubhouse, the best moderators tend to:</p>
                <ul class="underlined">
                    <li><span>Thoughtfully curate the speaker group:</span> Great moderators are thoughtful about who
                        they invite to
                        speak, and try to include diverse people, personalities, and perspectives. A moderator can
                        decide to run a "party room" with a lot of speakers, or a fireside chat with just a couple. All
                        types of rooms can work, and it‚Äôs up to each moderator to develop their own style.</li>
                    <li><span>Actively manage the conversation:</span> Some speakers are comfortable talking at length,
                        while others
                        are more reserved. Moderators can be a positive, balancing force, asking the quieter speakers to
                        share their perspectives and posing questions to the group.</li>
                    <li><span>Consider the audience experience:</span> Listeners enjoy joining the stage to ask
                        questions,
                        participate in the discussion, or even offer feedback in real-time. Take their questions when
                        appropriate, or feel free to focus on the current speakers‚Äîit‚Äôs totally up to you. When you do
                        take questions, it‚Äôs okay to return a listener to the audience after the question is answered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="secondaryHeading">Speaker</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText">Speakers are the people in a room who have the ability to talk. By default,
                    the person who starts the room is a speaker, and so is the first person to join them on stage.
                    Everyone else joins in the audience as a listener, and must be invited up if they wish to speak.
                    Successful speakers tend to:</p>
                <ul class="underlined">
                    <li><span>Share the stage:</span> Few conversations in Clubhouse look like a one-on-one interview.
                        Most begin
                        with one speaker and expand to three, five, or, even dozens of speakers. "Sharing the stage"
                        and taking turns speaking expands the breadth and depth of conversation and brings in diverse
                        voices.</li>
                    <li><span>Know when to mute (and unmute):</span> When you‚Äôre not actively speaking it‚Äôs generally
                        good to
                        tap
                        the mute button in the lower right to minimize background noise. But strategically unmuting is
                        just as important! This means going off mute for a few seconds to laugh, acknowledge what the
                        speaker said, signal that you want to speak next, or just be more present in "hangout" style
                        conversations.</li>
                    <li><span>Bow out anytime:</span> Feel free to leave the speaker section anytime without feeling
                        judged,
                        either
                        by going back to the audience or exiting the room using the "Leave quietly" button.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="secondaryHeading">Listener</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText">When you tap to join an existing conversation, you enter in the audience on
                    mute. This means
                    you are a listener!</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">As a listener on Clubhouse, you should relax and enjoy the conversation. In
                    other words:</p>
                <ul class="">
                    <li><span>Don‚Äôt feel pressure to speak:</span> Feel free to remain a listener even if you're invited
                        to
                        speak;
                        there is no
                        obligation to accept.</li>
                    <li><span>Raise your hand to chime in:</span> If you want to join the conversation, just raise your
                        hand by
                        tapping the
                        button in the lower right to let the moderator know that you‚Äôd like to be added as a speaker. If
                        they don‚Äôt
                        accept right away, don‚Äôt be offended. They may get lots of requests and can‚Äôt always get to all
                        of them.</li>
                    <li><span>Discover new people:</span> While you‚Äôre listening, tap around and learn more about the
                        people in
                        the
                        room. It‚Äôs
                        a good way to find new people to follow. üôÇ
                    </li>

                <p class="secondaryText underlined">If someone has not violated any of the Rules, but you would still
                    prefer not
                    to interact with them, here are some tools you can utilize.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">Room moderators decide who is in a room and can speak:</p>
                <ul class="">
                    <li>Accept or reject speakers: If you are a room moderator you decide who can speak. If you‚Äôd like
                        to invite someone from the audience to speak, just tap on the profile photo of that user and
                        select ‚ÄúInvite to Speak.‚Äù If someone else requests to speak, you have the option to decline.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mute or remove speakers: Rooms moderators can also temporarily mute a speaker or move them back
                        to the audience. To mute the speaker, tap on their profile photo to open the half-sheet, and
                        then tap the mute button to the right of their profile photo. To move them down to the audience,
                        tap on their profile photo to open the half-sheet, then tap ‚Äú‚ÄòMove to Audience.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>Remove from room: If someone is being disruptive or distressing to people in the room,
                        moderators can remove them, and they will no longer see or be able to re-enter the room. To
                        remove them from room, tap on their profile half-sheet, tap the ellipses and remove.
                    </li>
                    <p class="primaryText">Anyone can decide who they interact with:</p>
                    <li><span>Unfollow: </span>You can unfollow a user at any time. To do so, navigate to the user‚Äôs
                        profile
                        and tap
                        on the button that says ‚ÄúFollowing‚Äù to unselect it. They won‚Äôt be notified, and you won‚Äôt
                        receive any further notifications about their activity.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Block:</span> You can block a user at any time. On their profile, click on the 3 vertical
                        dots in
                        the
                        top right, and select ‚ÄúBlock.‚Äù¬†

                            </li>
                            <li>If a blocked user is speaking in a room that would otherwise be visible to you, that
                                room will be hidden from your feed by default, but there will be a capsule at the bottom
                                of your feed to let you know that the hidden room exists. If you would like to see the
                                room regardless, you can choose to tap that capsule and reveal the room.
                            </li>
                            <li>Blocked users will not be able to see or join any room that you create or in which you
                                are a moderator or speaker.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Shared block lists:</span> If there is someone who many people in your network have
                        blocked,
                        there will be a "!" icon on that person‚Äôs user profile to make you aware. This is personalized
                        to you, and is intended to help you make decisions about when to follow someone or bring them
                        up on stage.

                <h3 class="secondaryHeading">Incident Reporting</h3>
                <p class="secondaryText underlined">We depend on the vigilance of each user and the community to report
                    violations of Rules. If you believe a user has violated a Rule, you can report a Trust & Safety
                    incident. Note: Inappropriate use of the incident reporting system or intentional, false reports are
                    against our rules and are taken seriously.</p>
                <p class="secondaryText underlined"><span>Temporary audio recording:</span> Solely for the purpose of
                    supporting
                    incident investigations, we temporarily record the audio in a room while the room is live. If a user
                    reports a Trust and Safety violation while the room is active, we retain the audio for the purposes
                    of investigating the incident, and then delete it when the investigation is complete. If no incident
                    is reported in a room, we delete the temporary audio recording when the room ends. Audio from (i)
                    muted speakers and (ii) audience members is never captured, and all temporary audio recordings are
                    encrypted.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">You can report an incident in 2 ways:</p>
                <ul class="underlined">
                    <li><span>Report an incident in real time:</span> From inside a room, tap on the user you want to
                        report. A
                        profile "half-sheet" will pop up; tap the three horizontal dots at the top right, then tap
                        ‚ÄúReport an incident." Submitting a report from inside the room prompts us to retain the
                        temporary, encrypted audio recording for the purpose of investigating the incident, as noted
                        above.</li>
                    <li><span>Report a past incident:</span> To report an incident after the room has ended, you can go
                        to
                        the
                        profile of the user you want to report, tap the three horizontal dots at the top right, then tap
                        ‚ÄúReport an incident." Note that when you report an incident directly from a user's profile, we
                        will not have access to any room‚Äôs audio to support the investigation.</li>
