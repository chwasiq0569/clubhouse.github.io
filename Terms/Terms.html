                    this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all disputes or
                    claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Alpha Exploration Co., whether arising out
                    of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services,
                    any advertising, any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, shall be resolved
                    exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the
                    terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small
                    claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you
                    from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies
                    can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into
                    this Terms of Service, you and Alpha Exploration Co. are each waiving the right to a trial by
                    jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral
                    arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                    enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

                <p class="secondaryText">Alpha Exploration Co. is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
                    efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s satisfaction
                    by emailing customer support at support@alphaexplorationco.com. If such efforts prove
                    unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified
                    mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). Please e-mail us at support@alphaexplorationco.com
                    and we will promptly provide an address ("Notice Address") to which you can address postal mail.
                    The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
                    specific relief sought. If Alpha Exploration Co. and you do not resolve the claim within sixty
                    (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Alpha Exploration Co. may commence an
                    arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Alpha
                    Exploration Co. or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
                    determines the amount, if any, to which you or Alpha Exploration Co. is entitled.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">4. Arbitration Procedures</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the
                    American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer
                    Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For
                    information on the AAA, please visit its website, <a href="#">http://www.adr.org/.</a>
                    Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer
                    arbitration page,
                    <a href="#"> http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration</a>. If there is
                    any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement,
                    the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines
                    that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
                    fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of
                    Service as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited
                    to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
                    Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other
                    judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis
                    that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service and applicable law. Decisions
                    by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited
                    reasons.</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">Unless Alpha Exploration Co. and you agree otherwise, any arbitration
                    hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
                    consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are
                    unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be made by AAA. If your claim is for
                    $10,000 or less, Alpha Exploration Co. agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
                    conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic
                    hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
                    $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in
                    which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision
                    sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">5. Costs of Arbitration</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the
                    “Arbitration
                    Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement.
                    If the value of
                    the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, Alpha Exploration Co. will pay all
                    Arbitration Fees. If the
                    value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that
                    you are
                    economically unable to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise
                    determines for any
                    reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration Fees, Alpha
                    Exploration Co. will pay
                    your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
                    arbitration will be
                    prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Alpha Exploration Co. will pay as much of the
                    Arbitration Fees
                    as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any
                    payment of attorneys’
                    fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">6. Confidentiality</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award
                    by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">7. Severability</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this
                    Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative
                    Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to
                    replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
                    closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
                    Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that
                    any of the provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative
                    Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this
                    Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
                    unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of the Terms
                    of Service will continue to apply.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">8. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, Alpha
                    Exploration Co. agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than
                    a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change
                    by sending Alpha Exploration Co. written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to
                    the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
                    arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of
                    the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
                    Terms of Service).</p>
                <p class="secondaryHeading">Termination</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">You agree that Alpha Exploration Co., in its sole discretion, may suspend or
                    terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and discard any
                    content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if
                    Alpha Exploration Co. believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or
                    spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be
                    grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement
                    authorities. Alpha Exploration Co. may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue
                    providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination
                    of your access to the Service under any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without
                    prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Alpha Exploration Co. may immediately deactivate or
                    delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further
                    access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that Alpha Exploration Co. will not be
                    liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.</p>
                <p class="secondaryHeading">User Disputes</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other
                    user in connection with the Service and Alpha Exploration Co. will have no liability or
                    responsibility with respect thereto. Alpha Exploration Co. reserves the right, but has no
                    obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of the
                    Service.</p>
                <p class="primaryText">General</p>
                <p class="secondaryText">These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Alpha
                    Exploration Co. and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and
                    Alpha Exploration Co. with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and
                    conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or
                    third party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California
                    without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject
                    to arbitration, as set forth above, you and Alpha Exploration Co. agree to submit to the personal
                    and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within San Francisco County,
                    California. The failure of Alpha Exploration Co. to exercise or enforce any right or provision of
                    these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of
                    these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties
                    nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as
                    reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force
                    and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of
                    action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed
                    within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed
                    version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial
                    or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and
                    subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and
                    maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written
                    consent of Alpha Exploration Co., but Alpha Exploration Co. may assign or transfer this Terms of
                    Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are
                    for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either
                    email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of
                    Service or other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.</p>
